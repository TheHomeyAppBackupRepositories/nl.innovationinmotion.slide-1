Slide makes your curtains smart

Slide is a universal smart curtain solution that fits on all straight tracks up to six meters for singe and double curtains. Make your curtains smart by setting routines to wake up naturally with sunlight, secure your home when youâ€™re away with the Holiday Mode or create automatic isolation to save on your heating or cooling! Last but not least, just give your curtains a small push by hand, and Slide will take over with Touch&Go.

Install and setup your Slide device(s) using the official app by Innovation in Motion, on your smartphone. Login using your e-mail address and password of your Slide account, in the Homey app, and select which Slide(s) you want to add to Homey.
