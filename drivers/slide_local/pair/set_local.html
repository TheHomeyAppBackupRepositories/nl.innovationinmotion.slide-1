<p><img src="slide_local.png" style="max-width: 100%"></p>

<p>Briefly press the reset button twice, with about 0.5 second between the two presses.</p>

<p>If you see the LED (the other hole) rapidly flash five times, you have disabled the Cloud API and enabled the Local API.</p>

<p><i>(If you see the LED slowly flash two times, you have enabled the Cloud API and disabled the Local API)</i></p>
